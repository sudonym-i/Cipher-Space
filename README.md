# Cipher-Space

'encrypt' uses an iterative series to encrypt charcters in a non-repeating and unpredictable manner.

The 'decrypt' script takes a key as its parameters, and rebuilds the equations used to scramble the message in 'encrypt'.
this equation is used to predict what each character would look like, and keeps track of the equation's iteration count.


**STILL IN PROGRESS:
       - QR code reading functionality, 
       - Mobile implementation
